# floki

Floki OS is a non-POSIX operating system that is built on top of the Modular Operating System Internals (MOSI) architecture. The MOSI architecture replaces the conventional hierarchical kernel architecture with a flat architecture that is based on modules. All operating system components, including the file system and drivers, function independently with minimal privileges and interact with each other exclusively through an internal network. The current repository is a limited implementation of the MOSI design. The repository is based on the design philosophy and development process of the architecture.

This repository does not contain the full source code of Floki OS for security and legal reasons. It intentionally provides only limited, non-enforcing components intended to demonstrate the MOSI (Modular Operating System Internals) architecture, design philosophy, and development model. The code in this file is intentionally readable.
